Test datasets for our biorxiv preprint on phylogenetic tree visualization issues

This repository contains the two test files we used in our prepint.

Newick tree file "tree_comments.newick" contains the Newick tree from the paper 
where branch support values are written down as comments.

Newick tree file "tree_nodes.newick" contains the Newick tree from the paper 
where branch support values are written down as node labels.
