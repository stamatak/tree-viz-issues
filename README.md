# tree-viz-issues
Test datasets and test cases for our paper on phylogenetic tree visualization issues.
See [here](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/molbev/msx055) for the paper, 
and see [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/13/035360) for the preprint.

This repository contains the two test files we used in our prepint:

Newick tree file "tree_comments.newick" contains the Newick tree from the paper 
where branch support values are written down as comments.

Newick tree file "tree_nodes.newick" contains the Newick tree from the paper 
where branch support values are written down as node labels.

Furthermore, "test_cases" contains the scripts used for testing the bioinformatics toolkits.
