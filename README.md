# tree-viz-issues
Test datasets and test cases for our biorxiv preprint on phylogenetic tree visualization issues.
See [http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/25/035360](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/25/035360).

This repository contains the two test files we used in our prepint:

Newick tree file "tree_comments.newick" contains the Newick tree from the paper 
where branch support values are written down as comments.

Newick tree file "tree_nodes.newick" contains the Newick tree from the paper 
where branch support values are written down as node labels.

Furthermore, "test_cases" contains the scripts used for testing the bioinformatics toolkits.
